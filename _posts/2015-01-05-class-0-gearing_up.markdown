Tomorrow I begin my 11 week <a title="Winter Web Development 2015" href="http://www.starterleague.com/classes/web-development" target="_blank">Web Development</a> class at <a title="The Starter League" href="http://www.starterleague.com" target="_blank">The Starter League</a> here in Chicago. My plan is to write a post after every class, so 3 times a week for 11 weeks. Therefore my first official post will be tomorrow evening after class (or, more likely, on Tuesday), but I wanted to preface those posts with how I am feeling right now, before I begin.

In general, I am excited about the course and eager to learn how to build web apps, using Ruby-on-Rails and as much about front-end development (CSS, HTML, Javascript, etc) as I can. I don't have a good sense for how intense the course will be, but I suspect that it will be highly dependent on how much time and effort I am willing to contribute. It will be a success in large part based on how much I contribute to it.

What do I hope to accomplish by the end of the course? What are my goals? By stating this now, I can do a comparison when I finish up in late March:

(1) I want to build a web application. That is the stated goal of the course, and I expect to put in the hours and <strong>sitzfleisch</strong> to accomplish this by the time the 11 weeks are finished. I will treat the course like a full-time job, so my time commitment will be 40 hours per week, though I have another project that may limit my time in the first week or two. In any case, I want to build a functional web application by the end of the course and to learn enough about web development and design along the way, in order to use these skills going forward.

It is difficult to be more specific at the outset. How much Ruby will I learn? And Ruby-on-Rails? Will I be very comfortable with HTML5, CSS, and all the Javascript frameworks I may wish to know? I do expect to know enough to build a web app and to feel comfortable learning on my own. I want to have the beginnings of a portfolio of work.

Right now I feel very much like a beginner. At the end of this, I want to feel like an advanced beginner, someone who is proficient and confident enough to continue on my own, even with the knowledge that I still know very little and have a lot of practice and work ahead of me.

(2) I expect to meet some new people, to learn about web development (and software development more generally) as a career, and to meet some of the people who are part of the Chicago tech community. That is, I want to learn not only from the classroom and textbooks, but also from people who are already developers in their own right. I want to know as much as I can about how people make a living doing this, and the kinds of pathways that might be available to me when I finish.

And now off to bed to get a good night's sleep before class begins tomorrow afternoon.
