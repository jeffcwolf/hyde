Our first class was enjoyable. We did little coding—which is to be expected—but got to know each other in a limited way, as well as hearing from <a title="Raghu Betina - TedX Chicago" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtl9QG4qe6g" target="_blank">Raghu Betina</a>, our instructor. He presented us with an overview of the class, as well as how our experiences there would be different from what we might be used to. Raghu likened it to being in another world.

We were urged not to take notes that were akin to transcription, but to think, above all, of questions. To indicate what we thought we knew, or what was confusing.

We would be introduced, as well, to pair programming - which sounds like a great exercise, though it may take getting some used to, given the different backgrounds of each member of the class.

Raghu also encouraged us to reflect on our experiences every week, which is what I am doing on this site. In these reflections, he suggested we do at least the following:
<ul>
  <li>Explain what you have learned</li>
  <li>Describe what you do not understand</li>
  <li>Mention what you want to learn about next</li>
</ul>

We should, in general, pay attention to moments of unclarity, as well as the special 'light bulb' or 'Aha!' moments we have in class, or while trying to solve a problem.

For me, the most interesting part of the class was when Raghu took an idea from one of us (me, actually) and then, from scratch and in under 30 minutes, coded a prototype of that idea using Rails. It was impressive and exhilarating to see what he was able to do with Rails in such a short amount of time. One really gets the sense of the power of the framework, if that's possible in such short order. I was very impressed. Of course, it will be awhile before I'll even be able to develop a site of my own, let alone anything at that speed. But the potential is there, and that's what is motivating at this early stage.
