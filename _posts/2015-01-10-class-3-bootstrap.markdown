Today marked the end of our first week at The Starter League—10 more to go. I am quite enjoying the program so far and have been very impressed with the teaching, especially.

Now, today was likely the last day that we will focus exclusively on HTML &amp; CSS. I imagine that the easier part of the course is therefore now coming to an end and, with the introduction of Ruby, we are going to get into the more challenging aspects of programming. I am excited about it, though it means I <strong>really</strong> cannot have my PhD hanging over my head for much longer. I'll need to focus exclusively on this class, and I want to do just that. So this weekend, and the early part of the coming week are really my last chance to put any significant time into correcting the PhD. Thankfully, I'm on schedule to do that.

About today's class: it was initially not very exciting, I have to admit. We focused on positioning and especially how to use tables in HTML, and it all seemed a bit clunky. However, it turns out that this was a kind of bait-and-switch on the part of Raghu—in a great way. For after we had finished learning how to slog through table layout in HTML, Raghu introduced us to the magician behind the curtain of so many websites: <a title="Bootstrap" href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>.

This was a revelation of sorts to me, and the way Raghu set us up for appreciating it was very well done indeed. Here we were trying to slog through HTML tables and hand-code our CSS to achieve 12 column grid glory—with some difficulty and frustration. And then we learn that we have a tool at our disposal, which we are now in a position to understand, that does everything beautifully and almost automatically. Now I understand why there are so many good looking websites out there these days; not because the world is full of world-class front end developers but because of the free availability of Bootstrap.

And I am really excited to master it. Basically, it will allow me to create a mockup of the front-end of my web application in a short amount of time without sacrificing the aesthetics. Because it looks so good, and appears to be fairly accessible to use, I think I will positively <strong>enjoy</strong>creating my html/css pages.

I was worried, before this particular class began, that I had not done enough of the homework. But it turns out that was OK in this instance because I can now use Bootstrap to do the things that I was trying to learn how to do for last class's assignment.

The introduction of Bootstrap, and its capabilities, was a definite 'Aha!' moment for me. Consider my mind blown. I am excited to begin coding my web apps front pages using Bootstrap—onwards!
