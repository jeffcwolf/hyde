In today's class, we came to the end of our front-end development work (HTML/CSS/Bootstrap). I have to admit to being sad to see it end—we were just getting started with Bootstrap (and discovering <a title="Bootswatch" href="http://bootswatch.com" target="_blank">bootswatch.com</a>)! But we have to get going with Ruby, so we can dive into Rails next week.

And it's not as if I need to stop learning front-end dev tools, like Bootstrap. I can continue to learn as needed, and once this Web Dev class is complete (and I have my Rails app), I can return to front-end design/dev with a solid foundation for continuing on my own. I feel confident enough to begin that journey, even after only one week. CSS &amp; HTML are, I find, fairly straightforward and relatively uncomplicated. I'm sure that's not entirely true of Javascript, which we will touch upon later in the course.

The last part of the class today was our first introduction to programming with Ruby. I am not totally unfamiliar with it, so I think the next class will still be review for me, though by Friday I'll be learning new material too. And, like our knowledge of HTML/CSS, we will just be introduced to a small but critical (beginner-friendly) subset of the Ruby language, enough so that we can get going with Rails. There is, of course, a full world of Ruby out there, as well, and I'll pick up as much as I can along the way.

This is an interesting approach—to be introduced to just enough to begin building things—because it sets class at The Starter League apart from what one normally finds in either an academic setting or in online courses. In an academic setting, learning a programming language can seem too abstract and its connections to building applications remote. This can hamper motivation to really learn it. On the other hand, with online courses, one is often introduced to material in an indiscriminate way, without a sense of what is critically important to know, and what is not. So perhaps a coding class really will prove to be the sweet spot in terms of learning how to build functional applications.

Let's hope so!
