Unfortunately, I was out sick for this class and the video lectureÂ file was corrupted, so I am not able to summarise the content here. However, the app that the class worked on is available on GitHub, so I'm going to review that and talk to my classmates, in order to catch up. I also have a guide to using Heroku to deploy my web app.
