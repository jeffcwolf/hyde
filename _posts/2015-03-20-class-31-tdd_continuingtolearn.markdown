Today was our final class. We discussed resources for helping us to continue to learn now that our formal instruction is over. And we also touched on the concept of test-driven development, which will be critical to know as we move forward. Let me begin with that.

<strong>Test-Driven Development</strong>

So far we've done manual testing of our apps—clinking on links, verifying that actions and pages look and behave the way we intend them to. But this is not sustainable in the long term, as we make updates and our apps grow larger. Instead, we need to learn how to write small snippets of Ruby code to test the functionality of our application from the very beginning. Writing automated tests while we develop gives us the freedom and confident that things will continue to work as our apps evolve. This is the motivation behind <a title="Test-driven Development" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">test-driven development</a>.

TDD encourages us to translate our user stories (when formulating our apps) into a suite of simple tests. We write out our test cases first (in which our app initially fails), then write just enough code to pass the tests one-by-one. This is part of the red (test fails), green (test passes), refactor (improve code) development process of TDD. We practiced this a bit, and Raghu pointed us to further <a title="Everyday Rails with RSpec" href="https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec" target="_blank">resources</a> where we can learn how to begin to integrate (and practice) TDD into our development workflow.

<strong>Continuing to Learn</strong>

Besides TDD, the primary focus of our final class was knowing where to find resources that will help us continue to learn on our own. Raghu emphasised, in particular, that it will be a supremely good use of our time if we beefed up our knowledge and skill with the Ruby language. One we become fairly confident and fluent in Ruby—improving our 'idiom'—then there is nothing we can't do in terms of identifying and solving problems. Raghu pointed us to some resources that will help us in this regard, as well as deepening our knowledge of Rails. These include:

<em>Rails</em>
<ul>
  <li> Michael Hartl's <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/" target="_blank">Rails Tutorial</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rails-Edition-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321944275" target="_blank">The Rails 4 Way</a> by Fernandez and Faustino</li>
</ul>

<em>Ruby</em>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.manning.com/black3/" target="_blank">The Well-Grounded Rubyist</a> by David Black</li>
  <li>Russ Olsen's <a href="http://eloquentruby.com/" target="_blank">Eloquent Ruby</a></li>
</ul>

<em>TDD</em>

  <li>Aaron Sumner's <a title="Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec" href="https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec" target="_blank">Everyday Rails Testing With Rspec</a></li>
</ul>

</ul>

<strong>In Summary</strong>

Raghu told us that the ultimate goal of our 11 week class was to get us to the point where we could go out and continue to learn on our own. On this criterion, the class was, for me, certainly a success. I do feel that I now have the vocabulary and basic conceptual knowledge to build my Rails, Ruby, CSS, HTML, and even JS skills going forward. True, we are still in a sense beginners. But we are now <em>advanced beginners</em>, part of the community, ready to learn and build on our own without the training wheels of a structured curriculum. And this is very empowering.
