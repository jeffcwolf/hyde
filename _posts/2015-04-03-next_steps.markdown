Now that I am done with my Starter League course, I have been thinking a lot about next steps.

On the one hand, I have been sufficiently inspired by my experience learning to code that I hope to teach others how to code themselves. In that vein, I have become a Teaching Assistant for the Startup Programming and Management course at Northwestern's <a title="Kellogg School of Management" href="http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu" target="_blank">Kellogg School of Management</a>. That began this week. This builds very nicely off my own years teaching undergraduates history and philosophy, as a Graduate Student Instructor, at <a title="UC Berkeley" href="http://www.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a>.

On the other hand, I certainly would like more professional experience. I am acutely aware that, with all we learned in 11 weeks at The Starter League, we have just touched the surface of an entire world of learning. And I want to continue building off of that as much as I can. I am working on a few apps of my own, but I've also begun looking for opportunities to do this in a professional setting. Whether it be in the form of an apprenticeship or junior-level position of some kind, I'll be looking to get hands-on experience building my own skills, ideally working under the instructive hands of a mentor. Onwards and upwards!
